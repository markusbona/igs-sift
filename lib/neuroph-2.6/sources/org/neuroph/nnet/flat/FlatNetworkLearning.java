/**
 * Learning rule for flat networks.  The learning type is specified by the the learningType
 * property.  Currently the flat networks can be trained in the following three ways.
 * 
 * Classic momentum based propagation.  The learning rate and momentum are specified by using the
 * setLearningRate and setMomentum on the FlatNetworkLearning class.
 * 
 * Resilient Propagation.  No parameters are needed for this learning method.  RPROP is the best
 * general purpose training method.
 *
 * Manhattan update rule.  Not at all a good general purpose learning method, only useful in 
 * some situations.  A learning rate must be specified by using the setLearningRate method on
 * the FlatNetworkLearning class.
